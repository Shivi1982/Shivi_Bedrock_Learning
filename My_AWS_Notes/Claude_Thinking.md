1. Full thinking content is encrypted and returned in the signature field. This field is used to verify that thinking blocks were generated by Claude when passed back to the API.-
    - this is encrypted and included in a field called the "signature field" in the API response.
    - This signature field can be passed back to the API to verify that the thinking blocks were generated by Claude.
    - The primary purpose of this signature field is to allow verification that the thinking content was indeed generated by the Claude model. When you send this signature back to the API in subsequent requests, the API can decrypt and verify the authenticity of the thinking blocks.
2. Why This Is Done:
   - **Security**: Encrypting the thinking content ensures that it cannot be tampered with or read by unauthorized parties.
   - **Authenticity**: By including the signature, AWS can verify that the thinking content is genuine and was produced by the Claude model, maintaining the integrity of the interaction.
   - **Trust**: Users can trust that the responses and the reasoning behind them are authentic and have not been altered, which is crucial for applications requiring high security and reliability.
